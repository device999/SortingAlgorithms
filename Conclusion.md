As a conclusion i want to figure out which algorithm ,does what:

Buble sorting -  simple swapping until every element is his correct location, Complexity:O(n), i have done in O(n^2),through
i have two loops, first one is checking if there were no swaps on current step then finish if yes continue, second one is swapping. my favourite.

Bucket Sorting - i splitted array into set of arrays based on some condition and then used any other algorithm to sort them,complexity depends
on the sorting algorithm you have choosen.

Insertion Sorting - we are checking every element of the array if it is on the correct position,if no moving until we are there, O(n) best case
i have done it in O(n^2), with two loops

Merge Sorting - Splits array into pieces and then sorts them and merges back, complicated algorithm uses recursive method.not my favourite.

Selection Sort - Complexity O(n^2),it selects the element and looks for the number lower than current element,if he finds it he simple swaps
them.
